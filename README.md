# monte_carlo
# Using python, this advanced experimental examines the Monte Carlo method, 
# which is a wide range of computational algorithms, and its application in optimization,
# numerical integration, and probability distribution. This technique was used in four unique coding projects which 
# would otherwise be difficult to solve using another approach. The Monte Carlo technique was utilized to 
# approximate the value of Ï€, calculate the volume of N-dimensional spheres, generate Poisson deviates, and finally, 
# create and fit a Gaussian distribution.
